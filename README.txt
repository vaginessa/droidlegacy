Each shell script should be run in the .. directory relative to scripts/.  
It was simpler to write them this way.  In this case ADRD Test is the location these should be run from.
Each script is written in Bash.  I added comments, but it will be very hard to understand without familiarity of grep and sed.
It may have been cleaner to do all of this in Python, but it sort of evolved this way.  It works, but could be more efficient.
